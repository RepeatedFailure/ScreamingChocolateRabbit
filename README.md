# ScreamingChocolateRabbit
Arduino Code to Make a Chocolate Rabbit that Screams When Bitten

Parts List:

(1) Arduino or Off-brand/Elegoo Mega 2560 R3 (I’d recommend using an Arduino Nano to save space) + compatible power supply (A 9V battery won’t have enough current)

(1) DFPlayer Mini (beware knockoffs on amazon/elsewhere.  Knockoffs sometimes have different chip sets that don’t work well with the library.  The original is only slightly more expensive)

(1) 1k resistor (to convert 5V serial from Ardiuno to 3.3V for the MP3 module)

(1) 8Ohm 2W Speaker

(8+) lead free jumper wires

(2+) pieces of conductive copper tape to connect the silver leaf circuit to the jumper wires

(2+) Edible Silver/Gold Leaf Sheets (get more for practice, they are tricky to work with)

(2) food safe brushes to apply the leaf
